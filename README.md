# Data-Sources-Scenario

You were recently employed by a company (Connect) that has rendered all data-related services to
its clients for the past 2 months. You have been attached to a team, but today, you have been given
your first job sole project.
A new season of the English Premier League just commenced and your company assigned you to a
data engineering job posted by a client. They provided several website links to acquire the data from.
Your job is to have all this data extracted, transformed, and loaded into cloud storage and a PostgreSQL
database every Saturday and Sunday until the end of the season.
As a data engineer, you should be able to assess the requirements to properly decide which tool to use
for each task that would make the process efficient. For example, using Spark to transform 70 rows of
data can be counterproductive because that tool is meant for data that contains over a million rows.
The following figure visualizes the projectâ€™s data pipeline and tools to be used:
